This weather app project was undertaken to improve my understanding of API's, and asynchronous Javascript programming.

It requests data from the OPEN WEATHER API  to receive weather information, which is then dealt with through ES6 async/await functions. 
This project was initially difficult to undertake, as asynchronous programming and API's were a completely new topic, however this project provided several learning opportunities for me to improve my programming skills. 

Firstly, this project allowed me to further understand segmentation and organisation of code when programming, which made editing and bugfixing my code much easier. Additionally, bugfixing this project also allowed me to learn more about user interaction, and as a result I was able to implement visual feedback clues for users when their input did not match anything in the Open Weather API database. 

Finally, this project also allowed me to learn about responsive design; it work on both mobile and larger screens, which is suitable for a weather app.
